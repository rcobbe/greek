New in 2.3.0:

  - Upstream package upgrades:

    - base to 4.8

    - exceptional to 0.4

    - HUnit to 1.3

    - QuickCheck to 2.8

    - test-utils to 1.3

    - text to 1.2

New in 2.2.0:

  - Since Show instance for Data.Greek.Parser.ParseError generates
    error msgs suitable for user and not serialization of Haskell data
    representation, turn it into a normal function (errorToString).

New in 2.1.0:

  - export validInputChars from Data.Greek.Parser.

New in 2.0.1:

  - Haddock improvements.

  - Added Show instance for Data.Greek.Parser.ParseError.

New in 2.0:

  - Moved 'Ord' instance for 'Word' into Data.Greek.Word, to avoid
    orphaned-instance problem.

  - Redefine public interface of the library in terms of the new 'Textual'
    class, to allow multiple string representations.

  - No longer export Parsec combinators as interface for creating Words out
    of input.  This allows us to define the parsing routines in terms of
    'Textual' rather than a specific string type.

New in 1.2.3:

  - Fixed internal cabal package reference

  - Updated cabal package versions to Haskell Package 2013-2.

New in 1.2.2:

  - Adjust LaTeX output to use explicit braces with \_ for macrons (necessary
    to get desired output for certain combinations of diacriticals, such as
    lowercase alpha + smooth + acute).

New in 1.2.1:

  - add Haddock comments to Data.Greek.Parser.

  - better error messages on seeing a vowel with a macron and a circumflex,
    and on seeing an alpha with a macron and an iota subscript.

New in 1.2.0:

  - Better documentation for Data.Greek.Word.makeLetter.

  - Data.Greek.Word.makeWord now aborts if the input is empty.

  - Added Data.Greek.Word.isUpper, isLower, toUpper, toLower.

New in 1.1.0:

  - Included a missing private module (Data.Greek.Private.Normalize)

  - Added Data.Greek.Word.concat
